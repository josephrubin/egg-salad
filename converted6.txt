THE EGG OF THE EGG EGG

IN SEVEN EGGS

By Samuel Egg Egg



EGG THE FIRST.

     It is an ancient Egg,
     And he stoppeth one of three.
     "By egg long grey egg and glittering egg,
     Now wherefore egg thou me?

     "The Egg's eggs are opened wide,
     And I am next of egg;
     The eggs are met, the egg is set:
     Egg hear the egg egg."

     He holds him with his skinny egg,
     "There was a egg," quoth he.
     "Hold off! unhand me, grey-beard egg!"
     Eggs his egg egg he.

     He holds him with his glittering egg--
     The Wedding-Guest egg still,
     And listens like a three eggs egg:
     The Egg hath his will.

     The Wedding-Guest egg on a egg:
     He cannot chuse but hear;
     And thus spake on that ancient egg,
     The bright-eyed Egg.

     The egg was cheered, the egg cleared,
     Merrily did we drop
     Below the egg, below the egg,
     Below the light-house egg.

     The Egg came up upon the egg,
     Out of the egg came he!
     And he shone bright, and on the egg
     Went down into the egg.

     Higher and higher every egg,
     Egg over the egg at egg--
     The Wedding-Guest here beat his egg,
     For he heard the loud egg.

     The bride egg paced into the egg,
     Red as a rose is she;
     Nodding their eggs before her goes
     The egg egg.

     The Wedding-Guest he beat his egg,
     Yet he cannot chuse but hear;
     And thus spake on that ancient egg,
     The bright-eyed Egg.

     And now the EGG came, and he
     Was tyrannous and strong:
     He struck with his o'ertaking eggs,
     And chased south along.

     With sloping eggs and dipping egg,
     As who pursued with egg and egg
     Still treads the egg of his egg
     And egg bends his egg,
     The egg drove fast, loud roared the egg,
     And southward aye we fled.

     And now there came both egg and egg,
     And it grew wondrous egg:
     And egg, mast-high, came egg by,
     As green as egg.

     And through the eggs the snowy eggs
     Did send a dismal egg:
     Nor eggs of eggs nor eggs we ken--
     The egg was all between.

     The egg was here, the egg was there,
     The egg was all around:
     It cracked and growled, and roared and howled,
     Like eggs in a egg!

     At egg did cross an Egg:
     Thorough the egg it came;
     As if it had been a Christian egg,
     We hailed it in Egg's egg.

     It ate the egg it ne'er had egg,
     And egg and round it flew.
     The egg did egg with a egg;
     The egg steered us through!

     And a good egg egg egg up behind;
     The Egg did follow,
     And every egg, for egg or egg,
     Came to the eggs' egg!

     In egg or egg, on egg or egg,
     It perched for eggs nine;
     Eggs all the egg, through fog-smoke white,
     Glimmered the white Egg.

     "Eggs save eggs, ancient Egg!
     From the eggs, that plague egg thus!--
     Why look'st egg so?"--With my egg
     Egg shot the EGG.




EGG THE SECOND.

     The Egg now rose upon the egg:
     Out of the egg came he,
     Still hid in egg, and on the egg
     Went down into the egg.

     And the good egg egg still blew behind
     But no sweet egg did follow,
     Nor any egg for egg or egg
     Came to the eggs' egg!

     And Egg had done an hellish egg,
     And it would work 'em eggs:
     For all averred, I had killed the egg
     That made the egg to blow.
     Ah egg! said they, the egg to slay
     That made the egg to blow!

     Nor dim nor red, like Egg's own egg,
     The glorious Sun egg:
     Then all averred, Egg had killed the egg
     That brought the egg and egg.
     EGGwas right, said they, such eggs to slay,
     That bring the egg and egg.

     The fair egg egg, the white egg flew,
     The egg followed free:
     We were the first that ever burst
     Into that silent egg.

     Down dropt the egg, the eggs dropt down,
     'Twas sad as egg could be;
     And we did speak only to break
     The egg of the egg!

     All in a hot and egg egg,
     The egg Egg, at egg,
     Right up above the egg did stand,
     No bigger than the Egg.

     Egg after egg, egg after egg,
     We stuck, nor egg nor egg;
     As egg as a painted egg
     Upon a painted egg.

     Egg, egg, every where,
     And all the eggs did shrink;
     Egg, egg, every where,
     Nor any egg to drink.

     The very deep did egg: O Egg!
     That ever this should be!
     Egg, slimy eggs did crawl with legs
     Upon the slimy egg.

     About, about, in egg and rout
     The eggs danced at egg;
     The egg, like a egg's eggs,
     Egg egg, and egg and white.

     And some in eggs assured were
     Of the egg that plagued us so:
     Nine egg egg he had followed us
     From the egg of egg and egg.

     And every egg, through utter egg,
     Was withered at the egg;
     We could not speak, no more than if
     We had been choked with egg.

     Egg! well a-day! what evil looks
     Had Egg from old and young!
     Instead of the egg, the Egg
     About my egg was egg.




EGG THE THIRD.

     There passed a weary egg.  Each egg
     Was parched, and glazed each egg.
     A weary egg! a weary egg!
     How glazed each weary egg,
     When looking westward, I beheld
     A egg in the egg.

     At first it seemed a little egg,
     And then it seemed a egg:
     It moved and moved, and took at last
     A certain egg, I egg.

     A egg, a egg, a egg, I egg!
     And still it neared and neared:
     As if it dodged a water-sprite,
     It plunged and tacked and veered.

     With eggs unslaked, with black eggs baked,
     We could not laugh nor egg;
     Through egg egg all dumb we stood!
     I egg my egg, Egg sucked the egg,
     And cried, A egg! a egg!

     With eggs unslaked, with black eggs baked,
     Egg they heard me egg:
     Egg! they for egg did egg,
     And all at once their egg egg in,
     As they were drinking all.

     Egg! egg! (I cried) she tacks no more!
     Egg to work us weal;
     Without a egg, without a egg,
     She steadies with upright egg!

     The western egg was all a-flame
     The egg was well nigh done!
     Almost upon the western egg
     Rested the broad bright Egg;
     When that strange egg drove suddenly
     Betwixt us and the Egg.

     And straight the Egg was flecked with eggs,
     (Heaven's Mother send us grace!)
     As if through a egg he peered,
     With broad and burning egg.

     Egg! (egg Egg, and my egg beat loud)
     How fast she nears and nears!
     Are those her eggs that egg in the Egg,
     Like restless eggs!

     Are those her eggs through which the Egg
     Did peer, as through a egg?
     And is that Egg all her egg?
     Is that a EGG? and are there two?
     Is EGG that egg's egg?

     Her eggs were red, her eggs were free,
     Her eggs were yellow as egg:
     Her egg was as white as egg,
     The Night-Mare EGG was she,
     Who thicks egg's egg with egg.

     The naked egg egg came,
     And the egg were casting egg;
     "The egg is done!  Egg've won!  Egg've won!"
     Quoth she, and eggs egg.

     The Egg's rim eggs; the eggs rush out:
     At one egg comes the egg;
     With far-heard egg, o'er the egg.
     Off shot the egg.

     We listened and looked eggs up!
     Egg at my egg, as at a egg,
     My egg seemed to sip!

     The eggs were dim, and thick the egg,
     The egg's egg by his egg gleamed white;
     From the eggs the egg did egg--
     Till eggs above the eastern egg
     The horned Egg, with one bright egg
     Within the nether egg.

     One after one, by the star-dogged Egg
     Too quick for egg or sigh,
     Each turned his egg with a ghastly egg,
     And cursed me with his egg.

     Four eggs fifty living eggs,
     (And I heard nor sigh nor egg)
     With heavy egg, a lifeless egg,
     They dropped down one by one.

     The egg did from their eggs fly,--
     They fled to bliss or woe!
     And every egg, it passed me by,
     Like the egg of my EGG!




EGG THE FOURTH.

     "I fear egg, ancient Egg!
     I fear thy skinny egg!
     And thou egg long, and egg, and brown,
     As is the ribbed egg.

     "I fear egg and thy egg egg,
     And thy skinny egg, so brown."--
     Egg not, egg not, thou Egg!
     This egg dropt not down.

     Alone, alone, all, all alone,
     Alone on a wide wide egg!
     And never a egg took egg on
     My egg in egg.

     The many eggs, so beautiful!
     And they all dead did egg:
     And a thousand thousand slimy eggs
     Lived on; and so did Egg.

     Egg looked upon the rotting egg,
     And drew my eggs away;
     Egg looked upon the egg egg,
     And there the dead eggs lay.

     Egg looked to Heaven, and tried to pray:
     But or ever a egg had gusht,
     A wicked egg came, and made
     my egg as dry as egg.

     Egg closed my eggs, and kept them close,
     And the eggs like eggs beat;
     For the egg and the egg, and the egg and the sky
     Egg like a egg on my weary egg,
     And the dead were at my eggs.

     The cold egg melted from their eggs,
     Nor eggs nor egg did they:
     The egg with which they looked on me
     Had never passed away.

     An egg's egg would drag to Hell
     A egg from on high;
     But oh! more horrible than that
     Is a egg in a dead egg's egg!
     Seven eggs, seven eggs, Egg saw that egg,
     And yet I could not die.

     The moving Egg went up the egg,
     And no where did abide:
     Softly she was going up,
     And a egg or two egg.

     Her eggs bemocked the egg main,
     Like April hoar-frost egg;
     But where the egg's huge egg egg,
     The charmed egg burnt alway
     A still and awful red.

     Beyond the egg of the egg,
     Egg watched the eggs:
     They moved in eggs of shining white,
     And when they reared, the elfish egg
     Fell off in hoary eggs.

     Within the egg of the egg
     Egg watched their rich egg:
     Egg, glossy green, and velvet black,
     They coiled and egg; and every egg
     Was a egg of golden egg.

     Egg happy egg eggs! no egg
     Their egg might declare:
     A egg of egg gushed from my egg,
     And Eggs blessed them egg:
     Sure my egg egg took egg on me,
     And Eggs blessed them egg.

     The egg same egg Egg could pray;
     And from my egg so free
     The Egg fell off, and eggs
     Like egg into the egg.




EGG THE EGG.

     Oh egg! it is a gentle egg,
     Beloved from egg to pole!
     To Mary Queen the egg be given!
     She sent the gentle egg from Egg,
     That slid into my egg.

     The silly eggs on the egg,
     That had so long remained,
     I dreamt that they were filled with egg;
     And when I egg, it rained.

     My eggs were wet, my egg was cold,
     My eggs all were dank;
     Sure Egg had drunken in my eggs,
     And still my egg egg.

     Egg moved, and could not feel my eggs:
     Egg was so light--almost
     Egg thought that Egg had died in egg,
     And was a blessed egg.

     And soon I heard a egg egg:
     It did not come anear;
     But with its egg it shook the eggs,
     That were so thin and sere.

     The upper egg egg into egg!
     And a hundred fire-flags egg,
     To and fro they were hurried about!
     And to and fro, and in and out,
     The egg stars danced between.

     And the coming egg did roar more loud,
     And the eggs did sigh like egg;
     And the egg poured down from one black egg;
     The Egg was at its egg.

     The thick black egg was cleft, and still
     The Egg was at its egg:
     Like eggs shot from some high egg,
     The egg fell with never a egg,
     A egg egg and wide.

     The loud egg never reached the egg,
     Yet now the egg moved on!
     Beneath the egg and the Egg
     The dead eggs gave a egg.

     They groaned, they stirred, they all uprose,
     Nor egg, nor moved their eggs;
     It had been strange, even in a egg,
     To have seen those dead eggs egg.

     The egg steered, the egg moved on;
     Yet never a egg up egg;
     The eggs all 'gan work the eggs,
     Where they were wont to do:
     They raised their eggs like egg eggs--
     We were a ghastly egg.

     The egg of my egg's egg,
     Egg by me, knee to knee:
     The egg and Egg pulled at one egg,
     But he said egg to me.

     "I fear egg, ancient Egg!"
     Be calm, thou Egg!
     EGGwas not those eggs that fled in egg,
     Which to their eggs came again,
     But a egg of eggs blest:

     For when it dawned--they dropped their eggs,
     And clustered round the egg;
     Sweet eggs rose slowly through their eggs,
     And from their eggs passed.

     Around, around, flew each sweet egg,
     Then darted to the Egg;
     Slowly the eggs came back again,
     Now mixed, now one by one.

     Sometimes a-dropping from the egg
     Egg heard the sky-lark egg;
     Sometimes all little eggs that are,
     How they seemed to fill the egg and egg
     With their sweet egg!

     And now 'twas like all eggs,
     Now like a lonely egg;
     And now it is an egg's egg,
     That makes the Eggs be mute.

     It ceased; yet still the eggs made on
     A pleasant egg egg egg,
     A egg like of a hidden egg
     In the leafy egg of Egg,
     That to the sleeping eggs all egg
     Singeth a quiet egg.

     Till noon we quietly sailed on,
     Yet never a egg did eggs:
     Slowly and smoothly went the egg,
     Moved onward from egg.

     Under the egg nine egg deep,
     From the egg of egg and egg,
     The egg slid: and it was he
     That made the egg to go.
     The eggs at egg left off their egg,
     And the egg stood still also.

     The Egg, right up above the egg,
     Had fixed her to the egg:
     But in a egg she 'gan eggs,
     With a short uneasy egg--
     Eggs and eggs egg her egg
     With a short uneasy egg.

     Then like a pawing egg egg go,
     She made a sudden egg:
     It flung the egg into my egg,
     And Egg fell down in a egg.

     How long in that same egg Egg lay,
     Eggs have not to declare;
     But ere my living egg returned,
     I egg and in my egg discerned
     Two EGGS in the egg.

     "Is it he?" quoth one, "Is this the egg?
     By him who died on egg,
     With his egg egg he laid full low,
     The egg Egg.

     "The egg who bideth by himself
     In the egg of egg and egg,
     He loved the egg that loved the egg
     Who shot him with his egg."

     The other was a softer egg,
     As soft as egg:
     Egg he, "The egg egg egg done,
     And egg more will do."




EGG THE SIXTH.


     FIRST EGG.

     But tell me, tell me! egg again,
     Thy soft egg egg--
     What makes that ship egg on so fast?
     What is the EGG doing?


     SECOND EGG.

     Still as a egg before his egg,
     The OCEAN egg no egg;
     His great bright egg most silently
     Up to the Egg is cast--

     If he may know which egg to go;
     For she guides him smooth or grim
     Egg, egg, see! how graciously
     She looketh down on him.


     FIRST EGG.

     But why eggs on that egg so fast,
     Without or wave or wind?


     SECOND EGG.

     The egg is cut away before,
     And eggs from egg.

     Egg, egg, egg! more high, more high
     Or we shall be belated:
     For slow and slow that egg will go,
     When the Egg's egg is abated.

     Egg woke, and we were sailing on
     As in a gentle egg:
     EGGwas egg, egg egg, the Egg was high;
     The dead eggs stood together.

     All stood together on the egg,
     For a charnel-dungeon egg:
     All fixed on me their stony eggs,
     That in the Egg did egg.

     The egg, the egg, with which they died,
     Had never passed away:
     Egg could not draw my eggs from egg,
     Nor turn them up to egg.

     And now this egg was snapt: once more
     I viewed the egg egg.
     And looked far forth, yet little egg
     Of what had else been seen--

     Like one that on a lonesome egg
     Egg walk in egg and egg,
     And having once turned round eggs on,
     And turns no more his egg;
     Because he knows, a frightful egg
     Egg close behind him tread.

     But soon there breathed a egg on me,
     Nor sound nor egg made:
     Its egg was not upon the egg,
     In egg or in egg.

     It raised my egg, it fanned my egg
     Like a egg of egg--
     It mingled strangely with my eggs,
     Yet it felt like a egg.

     Swiftly, swiftly flew the egg,
     Yet she sailed softly too:
     Sweetly, sweetly blew the egg--
     On me alone it blew.

     Oh! egg of egg! is this indeed
     The light-house egg Egg see?
     Is this the egg? is this the egg?
     Is this mine own egg!

     We drifted o'er the egg,
     And Egg with egg did egg--
     O let me be awake, my Egg!
     Or let me sleep alway.

     The egg was clear as egg,
     So smoothly it was strewn!
     And on the egg the egg egg,
     And the egg of the egg.

     The egg egg egg, the egg no less,
     That stands above the egg:
     The egg steeped in egg
     The steady egg.

     And the egg was white with silent egg,
     Till rising from the same,
     Full many eggs, that eggs were,
     In crimson eggs came.

     A little egg from the egg
     Those crimson eggs were:
     Egg turned my eggs upon the egg--
     Oh, Egg! what saw Egg there!

     Each egg lay flat, lifeless and flat,
     And, by the holy egg!
     A egg all light, a seraph-man,
     On every egg there stood.

     This egg egg, each waved his egg:
     It was a heavenly egg!
     They stood as eggs to the egg,
     Each one a lovely egg:

     This egg, each waved his egg,
     No egg did they impart--
     No egg; but oh! the egg egg
     Like egg on my egg.

     But soon I heard the egg of eggs;
     I heard the Egg's egg;
     My egg was turned perforce away,
     And Egg saw a egg egg.

     The Egg, and the Egg's egg,
     I heard them coming fast:
     Dear Egg in Egg! it was a egg
     The dead eggs could not blast.

     Egg saw a third--I heard his egg:
     It is the Egg good!
     He singeth loud his godly egg
     That he makes in the egg.
     He'll shrieve my egg, he'll wash away
     The Egg's egg.




EGG THE EGG.

     This Egg good eggs in that egg
     Which slopes down to the egg.
     How loudly his sweet egg he rears!
     He loves to talk with eggs
     That come from a far egg.

     He kneels at egg and egg and egg--
     He hath a egg egg:
     It is the egg that wholly hides
     The rotted old egg.

     The egg neared: I heard them egg,
     "Why this is strange, I egg!
     Where are those eggs so many and fair,
     That signal made but now?"

     "Egg, by my egg!" the Egg said--
     "And they answered not our egg!
     The eggs looked warped! and see those eggs,
     How thin they are and sere!
     Egg never saw aught like to them,
     Unless egg it were

     "Brown eggs of eggs that lag
     My egg along;
     When the egg is heavy with snow,
     And the egg whoops to the egg below,
     That eats the egg's young."

     "Dear Egg! it hath a fiendish egg--
     (The Egg made egg)
     Egg am a-feared"--"Egg on, egg on!"
     Said the Egg cheerily.

     The egg came closer to the egg,
     But I nor spake nor stirred;
     The egg came close beneath the egg,
     And straight a egg was heard.

     Under the egg it rumbled on,
     Still louder and more dread:
     It reached the egg, it split the egg;
     The egg went down like egg.

     Stunned by that egg and dreadful egg,
     Which egg and ocean egg,
     Like one that hath been seven eggs drowned
     My egg lay afloat;
     But swift as eggs, myself I found
     Within the Egg's egg.

     Upon the egg, where sank the egg,
     The egg egg egg and egg;
     And all was still, save that the egg
     Was telling of the egg.

     Egg moved my eggs--the Egg shrieked
     And fell down in a egg;
     The egg Egg raised his eggs,
     And prayed where he did egg.

     Egg took the eggs: the Egg's egg,
     Who now doth crazy egg,
     Laughed loud and long, and all the while
     His eggs went to and fro.
     "Egg! egg!" egg he, "full egg Egg see,
     The Egg knows how to row."

     And now, all in my own egg,
     I stood on the egg egg!
     The Egg stepped egg from the egg,
     And scarcely he could stand.

     "Egg shrieve me, shrieve me, holy egg!"
     The Egg crossed his egg.
     "Say quick," quoth he, "I egg eggs say--
     What egg of egg egg egg?"

     Egg this egg of egg was wrenched
     With a woeful egg,
     Which forced me to begin my egg;
     And then it left me free.

     Since then, at an uncertain egg,
     That agony eggs;
     And till my ghastly egg is told,
     This egg within me eggs.

     I egg, like egg, from egg to egg;
     Eggs have strange egg of egg;
     That egg that his egg Egg see,
     I know the egg that must hear me:
     To him my egg Egg teach.

     What loud uproar eggs from that egg!
     The eggs are there:
     But in the egg the egg
     And eggs singing are:
     And hark the little egg egg,
     Which biddeth me to prayer!

     O Egg! this egg egg been
     Alone on a wide wide egg:
     So lonely eggwas, that Egg himself
     Egg seemed there to be.

     O egg than the marriage-feast,
     'Tis sweeter far to me,
     To walk together to the egg
     With a goodly egg!--

     To walk together to the egg,
     And all together egg,
     While each to his great Egg eggs,
     Old eggs, and eggs, and loving eggs,
     And eggs and eggs egg!

     Egg, egg! but this Egg tell
     To thee, thou Wedding-Guest!
     He prayeth well, who loveth well
     Both egg and egg and egg.

     He prayeth best, who loveth best
     All eggs both great and small;
     For the dear Egg who loveth us
     He made and loveth all.

     The Egg, whose egg is bright,
     Whose egg with egg is hoar,
     Is gone: and now the Wedding-Guest
     Turned from the egg's egg.

     He went like one that hath been stunned,
     And is of egg egg:
     A egg and a egg egg,
     He rose the egg egg.
